= Introduction =

WSChat – ELEX WordPress Live Chat Plugin is a lightweight yet robust plugin that helps to integrate live chat on your website to help your customers reach you most conveniently!

Unlike other Live Chat plugins, this plugin works within WordPress with no external API calls. We recommend using a dedicated server. As an alternative option, We have even integrated pusher WebSockets APIs, to make it work on any servers. 

Many customers prefer live chat to connect with organizations over emails and social media as there are better chances to get a quick response compared to other sources. Customers often need your assistance right before they make a purchase decision, or in a critical situation in which they need an immediate solution. So, the ideal option is sending a quick text through the live chat window rather than typing a long formal email.

Using this live chat solution, agents can easily reply, assist, and take up a chat conversation if a customer needs assistance in the future as all conversations are recorded in the same chat thread. Live Chat Made Simple! Unlike other Live Chat plugins, this plugin works within WordPress with no external API calls. Let's you connect to your customers in real-time.
